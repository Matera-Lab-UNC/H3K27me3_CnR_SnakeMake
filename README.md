# H3K27me3 CUTnRUN w/ IgG Normalization 
## Author: Benjamin McMichael
## Date: 12-02-2022

## File Origins
CnR files in this directory were copied from:
```
/nas/longleaf/home/bdmcmi/work/Benjamin/H3K27me3_CutnRun/norm_IgG_20221130
```
These were normalized to IgG and Snakemake was run using r/4.2.1.
This is different than the previously analyzed files which had no normalization and used r/3.3.1.

## R scripts
R scripts for DESeq2 used in this analysis were copied from:
```
/nas/longleaf/home/bdmcmi/work/Benjamin/H3K27me3_CutnRun/Pel_Sup_noCon_Analysis
```
These scripts were repurposed using the IgG control CnR outputs.

## CnR files in this directory were copied from:
#		 /nas/longleaf/home/bdmcmi/work/Benjamin/H3K27me3_CutnRun/norm_IgG_20221130
# These were normalized to IgG and Snakemake was run using r/4.2.1.
# This is different than the previously analyzed files which had no normalization and used r/3.3.1.

## R scripts for DESeq2 used in this analysis were copied from:
#		/nas/longleaf/home/bdmcmi/work/Benjamin/H3K27me3_CutnRun/Pel_Sup_noCon_Analysis
# These scripts were repurposed using the IgG control CnR outputs.
